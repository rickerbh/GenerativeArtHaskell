# Generative Art Haskell

Playground for [Haskell For Mac](http://haskellformac.com)

A collection of functions and drawings that I'm just experimenting with. It's messy. If you'd like to tidy it, or suggest better ways to do things please do via issues/pull reqeusts. 

Big props to the [Generative Art](http://www.bookdepository.com/Generative-Art-Matt-Pearson/9781935182627?a_aid=rickerbh) book, from which most of the algorithms and inspiration is drawn.
